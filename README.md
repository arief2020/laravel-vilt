# System Management Inventory

A personal portfolio project built to showcase my skills in developing a comprehensive inventory management system. This system focuses on managing products, tracking stock movements (in/out transactions), generating PDF reports, and visualizing data trends using interactive charts. It demonstrates my ability to create both frontend and backend components that interact seamlessly to provide a user-friendly experience.
